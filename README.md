Got it ✅

Here’s what I’ll do for you now:

1. **Generate a `README.md`** for your project so it looks polished, professional, and beginner-friendly.
2. Confirm that all packages used are **100% free & open-source** (safe to use for personal or commercial projects).
3. Design a **super cool UI** concept for your PyBackupSync app (with suggestions for Python frameworks).

## 📦 Requirements

The following Python packages are used (all **free & open-source**):

* **os** *(built-in)*
* **shutil** *(built-in)*
* **argparse** *(built-in)*

## 🎨 Future Plans – Super Cool UI

We plan to add a **graphical interface** for PyBackupSync so you can use it without the terminal.
Options we’re exploring:

* **Tkinter** *(built-in with Python)* – lightweight desktop UI
* **PyQt5 / PySide6** *(free for open-source)* – modern & sleek UI
* **Custom dark mode theme** with progress indicators and status logs

Example UI Concept:

* **Tabs** for `Backup` and `Restore`
* **File picker** for source & destination
* **Live progress bar** during file operations
* **Success & error notifications**

✅ **All packages are free** – no commercial restrictions.  
🎨 I can also **start building the UI now** in **Tkinter** or **PyQt5** with a modern theme so PyBackupSync looks professional.  

Do you want me to **go ahead and make the UI**?  
I can make it in Tkinter (no extra install needed) or PyQt5 (modern look).
