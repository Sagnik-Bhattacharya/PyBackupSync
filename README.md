- **Restore** backups to any destination folder safely
- **Encrypt** and **Decrypt** files using secure symmetric encryption (Fernet)
- Multi-threaded operations to keep UI responsive
- Detailed **progress bar** and **log console** for real-time status updates
- Premium, dark-themed UI using CustomTkinter
- Prevents accidental overwriting/restoration in the backup directory
- Supports large folder backups with hashing to avoid redundant copies

## Development Notes

* Backups are incremental and use file hashes to avoid re-copying unchanged files.
* Progress is reported via a callback function updating the GUI progress bar and log.
* Encryption uses Fernet symmetric key encryption with a persistent key stored in `secret.key`.
* Restoring prevents overwriting inside the backups folder to avoid data corruption.
* The app uses threads for running long tasks without freezing the UI.
* Make sure to **never commit your `backups/` folder or `secret.key`** to version control.

---

## Troubleshooting

* **Git warnings about CRLF:** These are normal on Windows and related to line endings. No action needed.
* **Nested Git repositories:** Avoid initializing Git repos inside your `backups/` folder or other project subfolders.
* **Backup or restore errors:** Check folder paths and permissions. Logs will be saved in `backup.log`.
* **Encryption errors:** Ensure files exist and have correct permissions.
